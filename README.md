## Hi there 👋

<img align="right" height="300" src="/assets/images/gopher-bracken.png">
I'm Bracken, a backend developer. Some of my themes are:

### ![Go logo](/assets/images/go.png) Go

I'm a maintainer of some Go modules, including [testify](https://github.com/stretchr/testify).

### ![Kubernetes logo](assets/images/kube.png) Containers

I'm an expert in the container space. Specifically Kubernetes, artifact registries, and container namespaces.

### 🧑‍🏫 Education

If you're any good at something, then you are a teacher. I spend a lot of my professional time educating others, whether presenting or pair programming. You can't do everything yourself, it's essential to inspire others to work as you do.

### ![Blueprint logo](assets/images/blueprint.png) Schema first

An API without deliberate design leads to spiraling costs in production as you work around rough edges and extend the surface. A forward-compatible API is better than a perfect API. Above all, **be normal**.

### ![Book logo](assets/images/book.png) Documentation

Write it down! Good code is self-documenting, but code is a fraction of your system. If it's not written down then it's lost. Runbooks, bootstrap guides.. Get into the habit of writing and maintaining them.

### ⚙️ Automation

If you don't automate the boring tasks then nobody will do them. Tests, linters, pipelines.. These are jobs for a machine.

## Right now

🇬🇧 -> 🇳🇴 After 15 years at IBM I got a new job and moved to Norway. I'm currently quite busy getting my life settled here so bear with me if I'm slow to respond on here.

🔭 At my new job in Piscada I'm learning about and working with knowledge graphs. I'm finding it amazing that the world of graph databases and Cypher seems almost completely isolated from the world of RDF and ontologies.

📫 Best way to reach me is AFK. Second best is any of those links over on the left.

🏃 If I'm not coding I'm probably running or playing ♟️ chess.
